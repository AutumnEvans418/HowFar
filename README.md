# HowFar
This is a Xamarin Forms app that will help students understand distance and metrology.

## What is it?
Metrology is a difficult thing to grasp.  It's hard to truly understand how big the sun really is, and how small an atom truly is.  HowFar is a solution to this problem.  It lets you compare any object relative to another.  Aside from comparing "inches" to "centimeter", you can compare any object, such as "whales" to "pencils" or "Earths" to "Galaxies".

## Features
The app allows you to login, create your objects using any measurement, and compare them to other objects in that app.
You can also buy premade object packs, view distances on a map regarding your objects, and event take quizes on your objects!

## How to use

1. Download the app
2. Login, or enter as a guest
3. Open the object manager and select objects to compare
4. Open the map and set two pins on the map
5. See the distance between the pins compared to objects
6. Open the Quizes, select your difficulty, and take a quiz regarding your object sizes
